Alright. That server should be fine.

Don't worry - I didn't remember the password.

And besides - the connection only gets established
when you yourself scan your node - I've worked with
that type of system myself before.

So, I'd use it as a backup system - *some* people might
want to break into your system, delete all your files
and brick it. This way you'll have your executables, themes
and system configuration files backed up.

Well, you should be clear to do pretty much anything now.
Maybe find some hacking group and do some contracts?
