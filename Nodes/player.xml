Hey - I've set up and configured a offline storage server for ya.

You can cycle it for uplink by running a scan on your computer -
the driver'll intercept that, send a command to the server to
permit connections from the internet and open a tunnel to it.
The server'll cut the tunnel once you end your SSH session on
the server.

Basically, a bunch of technical stuff, but tl;dr:

- Scan your computer to get a connection to the server.
- Log in.
- Do your stuff.
- Disconnect.

Don't worry about the security of it - it's pretty tight.
That is, unless you keep the tunnel from your computer up...


Password for the admin access is the annoying sound of a particular office item - you know the one I mean.

PS: You'll need to add a "-root" to that... setup issue.

DESTROY THIS FILE ONCE READ - DO NOT KEEP IT LYING AROUND ON YOUR COMPUTER.
SERIOUSLY. SECURTIY ISSUE.
