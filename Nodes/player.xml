Hey - I've set up and configured a offline storage server for ya.

You can cycle it for uplink by running a scan on your computer - the
driver'll intercept that, send a command to the server to permit
connections from the internet and open a tunnel to it. The server'll
cut the tunnel once you end your SSH session on it.
Similarly, if you scan the local IP to it, it also opens that tunnel.

Basically, a bunch of technical stuff, but tl;dr:

- Scan your computer to get a connection to the server.
- Log in.
- Do your stuff.
- Disconnect.

Don't worry about the security of it - it's pretty tight.

Password for the admin access is the annoying sound of a particular
office item - you should know the one I mean.

PS: You'll need to add a "-root" to that... setup issue.

DESTROY THIS FILE ONCE READ - DO NOT KEEP IT LYING AROUND ON YOUR COMPUTER.
SERIOUSLY. SECURITY ISSUE.</file>
